# Amazon Resources/Terraform Assessment
This repository contains Terraform code that sets up an infrastructure as code for an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster, VPC, subnets, gateways, NAT, route tables, security groups, private Docker registry, and MySQL database on AWS.

# Introduction
This repository provides a modular Terraform configuration to create and manage the required resources for running an EKS cluster and associated services on AWS. The infrastructure setup includes a VPC, public and private subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, route tables, security groups, private Docker registry, and MySQL database.

# Infrastructure Setup
The infrastructure setup consists of the following main components:

VPC: Provides network isolation and connectivity for the EKS cluster and services.
EKS Cluster: Sets up an EKS cluster with the specified configuration.
Private Docker Registry: Configures a private Docker registry using an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or any other desired container registry solution.
MySQL Database: Deploys a MySQL database using AWS RDS or any other preferred method.

# Steps to Reproduce
To reproduce this infrastructure setup, follow these steps:

Ensure you have valid AWS credentials and Terraform installed on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Fill in the desired variable values in the terraform.tfvars file.
Navigate to the root directory of the repository in your terminal.
Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration.
Run terraform plan to review the planned infrastructure changes.
If everything looks correct, run terraform apply to create the infrastructure.
Confirm the changes and allow Terraform to provision the resources.

# Assumptions and Design Choices
During the implementation of this infrastructure setup, the following assumptions and design choices were made:

The default AWS region is set to "us-west-2". You can change this value in the terraform.tfvars file.
The VPC is configured with a CIDR block of "10.0.0.0/16". Adjust this value if necessary.
Public and private subnets are created within the VPC. Ensure appropriate CIDR blocks and routing configurations are defined.
The EKS cluster is provisioned with the name "my-eks-cluster". Modify this value according to your preference.
The private Docker registry is not limited to a specific implementation method. You can set it up using an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or any other container registry solution.
The MySQL database is deployed using AWS RDS. Adjust the configuration as needed, considering factors such as instance type, storage, and backup options.

# Additional Considerations
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and IAM roles set up to provision the resources defined in this Terraform configuration.
Regularly update and maintain the Terraform modules, providers, and AWS SDK versions to benefit from new features, bug fixes, and security enhancements.
Take caution while modifying the infrastructure setup to avoid disruptions or potential security vulnerabilities. Always test changes in a staging or non-production environment before applying them to a live environment.
Consult the Terraform documentation and AWS best practices to further optimize and secure your infrastructure setup.
Feel free to modify and adapt the provided Terraform configuration to fit your specific requirements and extend the infrastructure as needed.
